# WeatherCompanion

An android application aimed at fetching the current weather conditions of the city as well as the forecast for the whole upcoming week by using open weather map API and displaying them
on the user's screen with the help of JSON parsing. The current location of the user is fetched using GPS so that notifications about the weather could be sent to
the user periodically.
